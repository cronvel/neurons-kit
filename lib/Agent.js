		* network: a Network instance
		* createNetwork: a method for creating a network from scratch
		* exploration: for policy-based agent, it defines how much the agent explore, try new things, instead of always choosing
		  the policy that it thinks is the best
		* learningRate: affect back-propagation, how fast the network adapt itself
