	Sort of genetic algorithm without gene, since coding a neural network have little sens.
	
	So this algorithm should work this way:
		* Concurrently test all network and give them a score
		* Select the best
		* Among the best, clone some of them and mutate them:
			* Change randomly some network weights
			* Remove some useless synapse, or whole neuron if its last synapse is removed
				* If a synapse is rarely used (most of time its excitation is closed to zero)
				* If the output signal is most of time closed to zero
			* Eventually add a synapse/neuron, if the network has not enough of them (how to detect that?)
				* If two neurons activate at the same time, it is said that they should connect
		* Cross 2 networks:
			* Clone the first network, create a training sample from the response of the second network
			* Train the clone with the training sample
			* Alternatively (since both network are probably structurally closed to each other at the begining),
				make the training sample have some of the first network response too
			* Crossing cost a lot of CPU, it should be used with care, probably only with the best of the best
