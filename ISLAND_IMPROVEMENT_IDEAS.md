## Ruleset

Instead of having one big scoring method, it could be better to split socring into various component.
Each component can be weighted.
This constitutes a *ruleset*.

The Mainland have its own ruleset, and it is the target to achieve.

So the basic ruleset should specify the weights for Mainland and weight ranges for Island.



## Island Improvement

Instead of having separated Island just to allow various evolution way, each Island should have a modified ruleset.

So each Island have its own rule weights, and even have some rules completely removed.

This allow per-Island specialization.
